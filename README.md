# FlutterTrafficIntercept

To intercept traffic from your Flutter-based Android APK using Burp Suite, you can modify the HTTP client configuration to route the traffic through Burp's proxy. Here's how you can do it:
  1. Open the file containing the code for your HTTP client (e.g., api_service.dart , http_client.dart or similar).
  2. Locate the method getHttpClient() or any other method responsible for creating the HTTP client object. It may be named getHttpClient(), createHttpClient(), or similar.
  3. Replace the existing code with the following code snippet:
  
  ``
  import 'dart:io';

  static HttpClient getHttpClient() {
  HttpClient client = new HttpClient()
    ..findProxy = (uri) {
      return "PROXY 127.0.0.1:8080;"; // Replace with the IP address and port of your Burp Suite proxy
    }
    ..badCertificateCallback = ((X509Certificate cert, String host, int port) => true);

  return client;
  }
``
  4. In the return "PROXY 127.0.0.1:8080;" line, replace 127.0.0.1 with the IP address of your Burp Suite proxy and 8080 with the corresponding port number.
  5. Save the file.
  
  By setting the findProxy property of the HttpClient object, you specify the proxy configuration to route the traffic through Burp Suite. 
  The badCertificateCallback is set to allow connections to hosts with self-signed certificates, which is often the case during testing and debugging.
  Make sure you have Burp Suite running and the proxy listener configured to listen on the specified IP address and port. 
  With these changes, your Flutter application should send its network traffic through the Burp Suite proxy, allowing you to intercept and analyze the requests and responses.
